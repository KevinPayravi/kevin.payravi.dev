Branding involved coming up with the visual identity and brand of both OHI/O and the event. The event went well, doubling in attendance compared to 2014! 
							In 2016, I continued those roles as a lead, and have also started contributing to establishing company relations. 
							Working with a fantastic and passionate goup of students and staff, OHI/O has provided a great opportunity for me to give back to the community and help foster a tech culture that I'm very passionate about.
