						<i>Board Member</i> (June 2018 – Present)
						<p class="indented">
							Wikimedia District of Columbia is a registered non-profit that serves as the regional outreach organization for Wikipedia and the other projects of the Wikimedia Foundation in the Wasahington D.C. area and beyond.
							After being named Volunteer of the Year for 2017 by the organization, I was invited to join the Board of Directors in 2018 and have served since.

						<h3 class="h3-small"><a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Wikimedians_User_Group">Ohio Wikimedians User Group</a></h3>
						<i>Founder and Organizer</i> (July 2016 – Present)
						<p class="indented">
							In July 2016, I founded the Ohio Wikimedians User Group, serving as the official Wikimedia affiliate for the Ohio area.
							The goal of the group is to support and develop the Wikimedia movement and community in Ohio.
							The group's first project was co-organizing <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Wiki_Loves_Monuments_2016_in_the_United_States">Wiki Loves Monuments 2016 in the United States</a>, a national photography contest with the goal of cataloging historical monuments and sites.
							Since then, we have worked to keep our members informed of local events, as well as having supported several Art+Feminism edit-athons throughout the state.
							Future initiatives include collaborating with local libraries and historical societies to host edit-a-thons, and to provide further resources for individuals hosting their own Wikimedia events.
						</p>

						<br />

						<h3 class="h3-small"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Connection">Wikipedia Connection</a></h3>
						<i>Founder and President</i> (March 2015 – May 2017)
						<p class="indented">
							In 2015, I founded Wikipedia Connection as a student organization at the Ohio State University alongside several of my peers.
							We are dedicated to exploring and contributing to Wikipedia. 
							Each semester, Wikipedia Connection hosts various events: workshops, edit-a-thons, outreach programs, photograph events, and more.
							We've successfully managed to educate students about Wikipedia, and have been able to engage students and staff to contribute themselves.
							Through doing all this, I've gained valuable experience in event organizing and team management, along with learning the best ways to engage different audiences.

						<h3 class="h3-small"><a href="http://hack.osu.edu/">OHI/O</a></h3>
						<i>Web Lead, Branding Lead, & Sponsor Coordinator</i> (March 2015 – May 2017)
						<p class="indented">
							After attending OHI/O 2014, Ohio State's flagship hackathon, I was hooked and interested in organizing. I joined OHI/O in 2015 to help organize that year's event. 
							In 2015, I served as co-lead on OHI/O's web and branding teams. Being part of the web team involved developing the hackathon's website and providing for internal tools for the team to use. Branding involved coming up with the visual identity and brand of both OHI/O and the event. The event went well, doubling in attendance compared to 2014! 
							In 2016, I continued those roles as a lead, and have also started contributing to establishing company relations. 
							Working with a fantastic and passionate goup of students and staff, OHI/O has provided a great opportunity for me to give back to the community and help foster a tech culture that I'm very passionate about.
